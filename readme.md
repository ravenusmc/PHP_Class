# PHP Work
## Intro

The purpose of this file is to hold all of my PHP work for my GTC PHP class. It contains work from both PHP 1 and 2 from the school. The course work, included here, covers both text book work and projects that I had to do for the course. The biggest projects are the midterm and final projects for both PHP 1 and 2. The website, for this work, will be found here: http://mcuddy12.info/2351/index.html. The PHP 1 final project is a mortgagae calculator while the PHP 2 final project is a simple social media site.
